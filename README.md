Manufacturing Demand & Availability Analysis

## Problem Statement

This project aims to understand demand behavior and availability risk in a planning-level supply chain dataset.

The dataset represents a reactive, order-driven supply chain where inventory buffers, order quantities, manufacturing lead times, and logistics delays jointly influence product availability.

The primary objective of this project is to **analyze demand signals and supply constraints** and frame a realistic predictive analytics problem before building any models.

## Dataset Description

This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and represents a **synthetic supply chain analytics dataset** designed for planning and decision-support analysis.

The data captures key aspects of the supply chain, including demand context, inventory buffers, order quantities, manufacturing capacity indicators, logistics lead times, and transportation attributes. It abstracts the flow of products from suppliers to customers without modeling execution-level processes.

The dataset is provided as a **planning snapshot rather than a detailed time series**, making it suitable for:
- Demand and availability analysis
- Inventory and stockout risk assessment
- Supply chain performance and risk interpretation

It is not intended for shop-floor manufacturing analysis or detailed logistics execution modeling.

This project focuses on understanding feature semantics and realistic problem framing before applying predictive models.
